Responses
================

Presentation
------------------

Responses is a questions & answers management software.

It's what www.stackoverflow.com would look like if it was more enterprise-oriented, instead
of being a public website.

This software was created by Julien Dubois in 2010, and was quickly updated in 2013 :

- It's 100% feature complete
- But it would need some time to iron out some issues caused by the 2013 update. For example, 
the newer version of Hibernate Search version has created some issues
- It's all in French!! i18n would not be complicated to do, but it's not done yet!
